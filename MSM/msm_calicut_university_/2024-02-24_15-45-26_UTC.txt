Her religion restricts her.
It restricts her from speaking ill about another,
It restricts her from falling prey to this manicured societal standards,
It restricts her from being narrowed to her external appearances,
and rather opens her ways into the society, where she speaks through her intellect, 
through her ideas. 
It restricts her from being a slave to this world by making her submit solely to the One Creator, 
Content with the covenants,
And to believe with utmost peace. 

The 'billion dollar' stereotypes of muslim women shove an image of her being oppressed.
From the small sarcastic references to explicitly potraying her as caged, the society did her wrong.
Perhaps if you change your source and speak to one of her, 
well defined by her identity, 
proud and unapologetic in her faith,
Maybe then you could see the strength and grace in what she potrays. ü§ç
